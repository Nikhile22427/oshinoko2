# Takeaways

1) If you want to do this in the future, get a degree in IT as it gives you the basic understanding of this stuff (think taking an anatomy class before going to med school)
<br>
2) Anyone can learn this really easily - even if you hate computers you could like this
<br>
3) Figure out how to use AI - it's indispensable and will shape the computer related fields in the future
<br>
4) Start small - you don't need to pay for classes or lectures to get started, there are free courses online, and the barrier for entry is very very low
<br>
5) You don't lose anything by trying, you only lose by not trying

	- Tracked down big hackers from other countries 
- Tricia Mercer - Leadership position at SD Cyber excellence and more
	- Stopped data leak and people stealing data from company
- Victor Nzeata - CEO of Cyber Brain Academy
	- Cleaned up old data from the US military in the middle east to stop the enemy from using it

# Cybersecurity Landscape

## stuff they did

D: Tracked down big hackers from other countries 

T: Stopped data leak and people stealing data from company

V: Cleaned up old data from the US millitary in the middle east to stop the enemy from using it

## big threats

T: Lack of cybersecurity knowledge 

D: Ransomware

V: AI 

## Zero Day - Vulnerability that cannot be patched 


## How do ethical hackers help and ethics concerns

V: 
- They are really useful because they simulate real attacks and that is critical for reinforcing weak points and strengthening. 
- Gray area b/c in the DOD a ethical hacker patched vulnerabilities but put a backdoor in... 

D:
- Not really ethical/moral but more of a legal question
- good penetration testers are really really useful 
- come talk to us if you are good at this

T:
- Integrity is super important because they have access to critical data

## What inspired you to do cybersecurity?

T:
- Book called the cuckoo's egg (I HAVE READ THIS WOW)

D:
- I hate computers. Always have. Still do
- Really easy to learn. Everybody should know it
- Went to Quantico and wanted to do something overseas. They suggested cyber and he took it

V:
- Loves coding?
- Saw parallels between military and cyber
- loves that it's always changing and changing

## What should CS students interested in cyber do as next steps

V:
- do background in IT 
- Very foundation of CS and cyber can be found there
- bachelor in IT 

D: 
- also do IT if you plan
- have soft skills - Will take you basically anywhere
	- people skills
	- be nice
	- be a leader
	- be reliable
	- when you walk into a room people should know you and like you
	- need to learn how to manage bad / unskilled people 

T: 
- Yes.
- Having a background in IT 
	- really gives you the essentials
	- can't do heart surgery without understanding basic anatomy
- Start building things at home - make a network, hack it, etc... real world stuff

# Career Opportunities

## Obstacles you have faced and how it impacts career

T: 
- I'm more on the business side
- speaking with business acumen
	- convincing the higher ups how to do things
	- "how does it make me money?" - leaders
	- dumb it down so they understand why its necessary and why they should invest
- How do you take what you know 

D: 
- My personal challenge was being ignorant and having to overcome it
- there's going to be a steep learning curve. A lot of times
- Companies won't share data with us
- People wont report to law enforcement

V:
- People.
- Have to pick the top 5, have to ask people to do things that are really important
- BCP?
- When you are faced with adversarial danger (country stuff), how do i get stuff done with just 1/5 of my staff?

# Future of Cybersecurity

## What trends in Cyber are you anticipating for the next 5-10 years and how will it affect jobs

V:
- lot more specializations
	- Health IT
	- Human element of risk
	- Need more people specialized in AI
- Have the same skillset of hackers but being able to also incorporate more organic stuff
	-  For example, pacemaker that could be hacked

D:
- Echo AI.
- Talked to a lot of companies / coders who are terrified of losing jobs
- People are firing staff cuz of AI
- Very bad time for coders who aren't good because AI is being trained on code
- Govt jobs need skilled coders

T
- Agree for AI.
- Next 5-10 years almost every entity will be hiring for cybersecurity
	-  small/medium companies beginning to think about that
- Open field of learning how to secure code

## How do cybersecurity professionals prepare for constantly evolving threats

T
- lot of sources that you can subscribe to
- constantly being informed and up to date
- not a profession that you can turn on/off outside 9-5
- intrinsical need to want to research
- just dig in

D:
- I do a lot of reading.
- A lot of classified and unclassified stuff
- You are going to need a network. Identify people who are really really good and become friends with them. They will teach you things, get you jobs, and will advance you
- You can't go home and think you are done.

V:
- Brother who is a doctor
	- always reading and learning
- just as any other profession you have to maintain competency
- being in the know - staying updated
- Cybersecurity is a team sport.
- Solve problems faster
- community that you create by being in this workforce

## Audience Q&A

Q: How quickly does the pipeline go from research to action

D: 
- A lot of the novel exploits and techniques never get off the ground because it requires too much technical knowledge
- When it does, it only takes hours or days for the exploit to be taken advantage of 
V:
- Patch Tuesday, Exploit Wednesday

Q: How do you make sure that you are always up to date on new developments

V:
- Always go to conferences, partner meetings, share w/ other people and they will share w you (mostly)
- Real world feedback

D: 
- I read the news.
- Information sharing networks are very very dense.
- By industry, by sector, govt private stuff
